### Using `as`

You can render as a different element or component by passing `as`.

```tsx
<VStack gap="md">
  <Text as="b">I’ve always loved fireworks!</Text>

  <Text as="i">I’ve always loved fireworks!</Text>

  <Text as="u">I’ve always loved fireworks!</Text>

  <Text as="abbr">I’ve always loved fireworks!</Text>

  <Text as="del">I’ve always loved fireworks!</Text>

  <Text as="em">I’ve always loved fireworks!</Text>

  <Text as="ins">I’ve always loved fireworks!</Text>

  <Text as="kbd">I’ve always loved fireworks!</Text>

  <Text as="mark">I’ve always loved fireworks!</Text>

  <Text as="s">I’ve always loved fireworks!</Text>

  <Text as="samp">I’ve always loved fireworks!</Text>

  <Text as="sub">I’ve always loved fireworks!</Text>
</VStack>
```

### Truncating Text

If you want to truncate text after a certain number of lines, specify the number of lines in `noOfLines`. If the specified number of lines is exceeded, an ellipsis will be displayed.

```tsx
<VStack gap="md">
  <Text fontSize="2xl" noOfLines={3}>
    "DRAGON BALL" is a Japanese manga work by Akira Toriyama. It was serialized in "Weekly Shonen
    Jump" (Shueisha) from issue 51 in 1984 to issue 25 in 1995. The story revolves around the
    treasure "DRAGON BALL", which grants any one wish if all seven scattered balls around the world
    are collected, and the protagonist Goku (Son Goku), depicting "adventure", "dream", "battle",
    "friendship", and so on in a long manga.
  </Text>
