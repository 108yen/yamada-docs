Yamada UI supports semantic tokens of all scales (such as color and font size).

:::note
Semantic tokens are terms used in design systems, etc., referring to abstracted variables or tokens of design attributes such as color and font size. These tokens are named so that their function and meaning can be intuitively understood from their names.
:::

The values that are actually set are as follows.

```ts
export const semantics: ThemeSemantics = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'blue.500',
    secondary: 'purple.500',
    success: 'emerald.500',
    warning: 'orange.500',
    danger: 'red.500',
    link: 'sky.500',
  },
  colorSchemes: {
    primary: 'blue',
    secondary: 'purple',
    success: 'emerald',
    warning: 'orange',
    danger: 'red',
    link: 'sky',
  },
}
```

:::note status=warning
The values that can be selected in `colorSchemes` are only the tokens where `Hue (from 50 to 950)` is defined in the theme's `colors`.
:::

Semantic tokens are defined in the theme's `semantics`.

```tsx live=false
import { UIProvider, extendTheme } from '@yamada-ui/react'

const semantics = {
  colors: {
    brand: 'violet.500',
  },
}

const customTheme = extendTheme({ semantics })()

const App = () => {
  return (
    <UIProvider theme={customTheme}>
      <YourApplication />
    </UIProvider>
  )
}
```

```tsx live=false
<Text color='brand'>This is Brand color</Text>
```

This generates a semantic token called `brand` for `colors.violet.500` defined in the [default theme](/styled-system/theming/default-theme).
