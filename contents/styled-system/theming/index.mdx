A theme is a modifiable object where tokens of many properties such as component styles, colors, spaces, font sizes, and many others are defined.

Tokens of the theme are used in `Style props` and so on. Please check the reference of each `Style props` from [here](/styled-system/style-props).

:::note
Yamada UI has a [default theme](/styled-system/theming/default-theme) that can be used immediately.
