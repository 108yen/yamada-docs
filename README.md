## Respect

Yamada UI has drawn a lot of inspiration from [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui), [MUI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui) and [Mantine UI](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine). This has brought me wonderful experiences in my life. I am deeply grateful to Segun Adebayo and all the gods who have given me such experiences. And I love them.

## Features

- Ease of Styling: Yamada UI contains a set of layout components like `Box` and
  `Stack` that make it easy to style your components by passing props.
- Flexible & composable: Yamada UI components are built on top of a React UI
  Primitive for endless composability.
- Animation: Yamada UI provides hooks that allow for easy declaration of animations.
  These hooks can be written similar to CSS animations and are supported by all components.
- Color mode: Yamada UI makes it easy to set values for each color mode in the props of all components.
  This is not currently implemented in any other React UI component library.
- Theme switching: Yamada UI allows users to switch themes.
  Users can adapt their own themes and use web applications and websites.
  This is not currently implemented in any other React UI component library.
- Other features:
  Yamada UI comes with essential loading and notification features that are considered crucial for modern web applications and websites.
  This means you don't have to define them individually yourself.
